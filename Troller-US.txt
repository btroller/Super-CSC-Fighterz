As an advanced user, I want characters to have strengths and weaknesses, so that I can create my own strategies.

As a user, I want there to be an indication of my playerâ€™s health visible on the screen, so that I can play strategically in an effort to win.

As a user, I want the game to display the controls when the game starts, so that I know how to play once the game begins.
